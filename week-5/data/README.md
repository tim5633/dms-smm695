# Data Info

Both _artists.json_ and _artworks.json_ contain data provided by the [Tate](https://github.com/tategallery/collection).

I have modified the original data, deleting some fields and setting some new.

During the lecture, we are going to load also the _CDs\_and\_Vinyl\_5.json_ file which you can download [here](http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFilesSmall/CDs_and_Vinyl_5.json.gz).
